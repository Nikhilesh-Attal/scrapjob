ScrapJob Project Recap
======================

Overview:
---------
ScrapJob is a Next.js (App Router) application designed to streamline and supercharge the job search process. It combines job aggregation with AI-powered tools to help users find suitable opportunities and optimize their resumes for better job matching.

Key Features:
-------------
1. **Centralized Job Scraper**
   - Fetches job listings from a Google Sheet (can be replaced with any REST API or data source).
   - Dynamic filtering and CSV export.
   - Smart UI actions for analyzing/applying to jobs.

2. **AI-Powered ATS Checker**
   - Users upload or paste their resume (supports PDF, DOCX, TXT).
   - Compares resume/profile to a job description using AI (Google Gemini via Genkit).
   - Provides a match score, skill gap analysis, and AI-generated job summary.

3. **AI Resume Enhancer**
   - One-click AI-powered resume rewrite and formatting.
   - Improves grammar, structure, and professionalism without inventing new information.

4. **Authentication & User Data**
   - Google sign-in (Firebase Auth by default, but can be swapped for any provider).
   - User data (usage counts, resume links) stored in Firestore (can be replaced with any DB).

5. **Subscription API**
   - Users can subscribe with email (stored in Firestore, but logic is generic and can be adapted).

Tech Stack:
-----------
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript)
- **UI:** ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS
- **AI:** Google Gemini via Genkit
- **Auth/DB:** Firebase (default, but not required for hosting)
- **Data Source:** Google Sheets (can be replaced)

Architecture:
-------------
- `src/app/` - Next.js app directory (routes, pages, API endpoints)
- `src/components/` - UI components (including ShadCN-based and custom components)
- `src/ai/flows/` - AI logic for job analysis and resume enhancement
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks (auth, toast, mobile detection)
- `src/lib/` - Utilities (Firebase, user actions, rate limiter, etc.)
- `src/types/` - TypeScript types

Deployment Flexibility:
-----------------------
- The app is not tightly coupled to Firebase Hosting. You can deploy it on Vercel, Netlify, AWS, or any platform that supports Next.js.
- For authentication and database, you can swap Firebase for any other provider (e.g., Auth0, Supabase, custom backend) by updating the logic in `src/lib/firebase.ts` and related hooks.
- The job data source (currently Google Sheets) can be replaced with any REST API or database by modifying the API route in `src/app/api/scrape/route.ts`.

How to Adapt for Non-Firebase Hosting:
--------------------------------------
- Remove or replace Firebase-specific logic in `src/lib/firebase.ts`, `src/hooks/use-auth.tsx`, and API routes.
- Update environment variables and deployment scripts for your chosen platform.
- Ensure any serverless functions or API routes are compatible with your hosting provider.

This recap provides a high-level understanding of the ScrapJob project, its architecture, and how to adapt it for different hosting and backend solutions.
